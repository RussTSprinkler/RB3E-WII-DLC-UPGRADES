# RB3E-WII-DLC-UPGRADES

This is a repository of upgrades for the DLC and exports found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19aPhcDbeoWBI5dnQcFKFc_2D8Y8GbPI98Ak-j-IKoaQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

Just drag the rb3 folder over the root of your SD card.

(in some VERY rare cases, full songs may be uploaded to this as every part of it must be included/upgraded. feel free to discard any you may not want)

# INSTALLATION

Just drag the associated RB3 folder over the root of your SD card, overwrite any file, and recache with [LavaManager](https://github.com/InvoxiPlayGames/LavaManager).
